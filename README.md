# 🛍️ Walmart Retail Sales Forecasting and Analysis

Welcome to my end-to-end data science project where I dive into **real-world retail sales data from Walmart** and use machine learning to **predict weekly sales**, derive **business insights**, and demonstrate **practical problem-solving skills** that align with industry expectations.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

In the retail sector, being able to **predict sales accurately** helps in inventory management, staffing, and marketing decisions. This project leverages historical sales data from Walmart stores to:

- Understand sales patterns across time, temperature, CPI, and fuel prices.
- Evaluate the **impact of holidays** on sales.
- Build predictive models to **forecast weekly sales** using Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.
- Translate findings into **valuable business insights** and **data-driven decisions**.

## 🧠 Key Highlights

✅ Cleaned and feature-engineered structured retail data  
✅ Performed meaningful **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
✅ Created new **time-based features** (Month, Year)  
✅ Built and compared **multiple ML models**:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Linear Regression  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Random Forest Regressor  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• XGBoost Regressor  
✅ Evaluated models using **R² Score** and **Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)**  
✅ Extracted **business insights** that mimic real-world retail challenges  
✅ Explained all decisions like a **data analyst in a retail firm**

## 📊 Technologies Used

- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)
- **XGBoost**
- **Jupyter Notebook** for documentation and presentation

## 📈 Results Snapshot

| Model                  | R² Score | RMSE        |
|------------------------|----------|-------------|
| Linear Regression      | ~0.02    | High error  |
| Random Forest Regressor | ↑ Better | ↓ Lower     |
| XGBoost Regressor      | Best     | Lowest      |

📉 The Linear Regression model underperformed, highlighting the **non-linear nature** of the problem. Both Random Forest and XGBoost significantly improved performance and captured complex patterns.

## 💡 Business Insights

- **Holiday weeks** often impact sales, sometimes negatively due to store closures.
- **Temperature and Fuel Prices** show minor but notable effects in certain months.
- Sales patterns differ across **months and years**, which can guide **marketing strategies**.
- Predictive models can support **inventory and supply chain planning**.
